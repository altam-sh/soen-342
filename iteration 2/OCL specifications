1. Each sensor deployed by the system must have a unique id (do not use isUnique).
context Registry
inv: self.sensor_list.sensor → forAll(s1, s2: Sensor | s1 <> s2 implies s1.sensorId <> s2.sensorId)


2.  All sensors deployed in the system are sensors that are maintained by the system. (In other words, the system does not deploy a sensor which is not registered.)
context Registry
inv: self.sensor_list.sensor → forAll(s: Sensor | sensor.deployed = true implies includesAll(self.map.sensor and self.read.sensor)

3.Every deployed sensor must be associated with a location that exists in the corresponding location registry
context Sensor
inv self.deployed = true implies self.map_item.location 

4. Every location maintained by the system is associated with a unique sensor.
context: Location
inv self.map_item.sensor.allInstances() implies self.sensor → isUnique(sensorId)
